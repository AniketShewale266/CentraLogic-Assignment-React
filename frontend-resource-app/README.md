# Frontend Resource Project
## Desription: ResourceHub is a frontend web application designed to help developers quickly find and access various frontend development resources. The application categorizes resources into different types such as illustrations, icons, fonts, CSS libraries, JavaScript libraries, and more. Users can easily navigate through these categories and access the relevant websites. Additionally, users can mark resources as favorites for quick access later. The application is built using React and utilizes Redux for state management.
